# Project Title: School Repairs â€“ Create a platform for tracking and reporting the condition of public school buildings

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a centralized platform to monitor and report the condition of public school buildings within the Waterloo Region District School Board (WRDSB). WRDSB was selected due to recent findings indicating that approximately 45% of its 123 schools are below the state of good repair, with a maintenance backlog estimated at $178 million. The platform seeks to streamline maintenance reporting, enhance transparency, and ensure efficient resource allocation to address critical infrastructure needs, ultimately improving the safety and learning environment for students and staff across the region.

## Key Issues
Recent assessments have highlighted significant challenges regarding the condition of public school buildings in the Waterloo Region. According to the Financial Accountability Office (FAO) of Ontario:

- **Aging and Deteriorating Infrastructure**: Approximately 45% of WRDSB's 123 schools are below the state of good repair, with 55 schools requiring rehabilitation or replacement.
- **Significant Maintenance Backlog**: The infrastructure backlog for these schools is estimated at $178 million, with an additional $401 million needed to bring all schools to a state of good repair over the next decade, totaling $579 million in projected costs.
- **Lack of Centralized Reporting System**: Currently, there's no unified platform for reporting and tracking maintenance issues, leading to delays and inefficiencies.


## Actionable Requirements
